# ParentMeshToArmature

## Why this plugin

My workflow is to model seperate objects for a part/tank/model/plane/etc..

But animation export would result in multiple animations on the export...

But if it was one mesh with an armature, then it's fine

But having to apply the vertex groups for every single mesh object was a slow and boring process...

Now it's just a click button for the entire scene
